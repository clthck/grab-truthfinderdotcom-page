## Prerequisites
This script is written in Node.js, so you need to have Node.js installed (either on your local machine or remote server).  
I recommend to check out [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-with-nvm-node-version-manager-on-a-vps) to install Node.js environment.  

You need to install the latest version of Node.js, or at least v7.2 and above.  

## Configuration
Create a new file in the root path by copying `env` file and name it `.env`.  
Then, fill the necessary environment variables inside the `.env` file.

## Run
Now hit the the following commands in your favorite terminal.  
```
npm i
npm start
```

Wait for the script execution to be finished. If the output JSON includes success status, everything worked as planned. Now you must have what you want in your inbox. ;)
